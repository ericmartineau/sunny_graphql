# 1.5.0
- Native transitions will now use the Cupertino page route on iOS and Material page route on android. This will enable swipe gestures on iOS.

- **You should not be using Cupertino types on non-iOS platforms. It's up to you, but it's bad design**.

# 1.3.0
- **BREAKING**: Parameters now return an array of results even if they have a single value.

- Results can now be passed via `Navigator.pop` via use of a `Future`.
- A few bug fixes

# 1.1.0

**BREAKING**: In order to support function handlers you will need to change all of your route 
handler definitions to use the new `Handler` class. The `RouteHandler` definition has now been 
removed.

Swapping out the handlers should be as simple as changing:

```dart
RouteHandler usersHandler = (Map<String, String> params) {}
```

to

```dart
var usersHandler = new Handler(handlerFunc: (BuildContext context, Map<String, dynamic> params) {});
```
